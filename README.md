Required collections: 
   lysseus/utils
   
Main module: marble.rkt
   
This game uses Racket 2htdp/image and 2htdp/universe and is keyboard event-driven.

Use the arrow keys to choose the direction the marble should go. The marble will continue in that direction until it runs off the board or is stopped by an obstacle block. The goal is to get the marble through the maze to the star. After all the mazes have been completed the game ends.
